# geek-js-libraries

This repository is designed to showcase how to implement some popular JavaScript libraries, specifically `animejs` and `lodash`, in a vanilla JavaScript environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone <https://github.com/SJ22032003/geek-js-libraries>
```

## Libraries Used

### Animejs

Animejs is a lightweight JavaScript animation library. It works with any CSS properties, individual CSS transforms, SVG or any DOM attributes, and JavaScript Objects.

In the animejs directory, you'll find an index.html file where we've implemented some basic animations using Animejs.

### Lodash

Lodash is a JavaScript utility library delivering consistency, modularity, performance, & extras. It provides utility functions for common programming tasks using the functional programming paradigm.

In the lodash directory, you'll find an index.html file where we've implemented some basic operations using Lodash.

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, simply open the index.html file in either the animejs or lodash directory in your web browser.
